\subsection{media access and fault tolerance layer}
\label{sec:bus:design:layer2}

The second layer of our protocol can be seen as a composition of two internal layers, namely the media access sublayer controling the basic bus access as depicted in section \ref{sec:bus:basicaccess} and the state machine defining the communication process and the fault tolerant sublayer providing basic fault tolerant mechnaisms like the FTNSH (see section \ref{sec:bus:ftnsh}).\\

These two sublayers and their interactions are described in the sections \ref{sec:bus:design:layer2:mac} and \ref{sec:bus:design:layer2:ft} in detail. In the following section we describe the general workflow of the Mac \& FT Layer.\\
