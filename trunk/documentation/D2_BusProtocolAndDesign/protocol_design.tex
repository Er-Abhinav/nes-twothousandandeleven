\section{Bus Protocol - Design}
\label{sec:bus:design}
According to our requirements from \cite[NESD1]{NESD1} we segmented the protocol in 
independent layers arbitrarily exchangeable with respect to the below defined interfaces.\\

We will see in the subsequent sections the protocols CNI (Communication Network Interface) 
is considered as a stand alone component with push and pull interfaces.
As this is not always the case the overall control mechanisms of the 
protocol can slightly vary depending on the platform used.\\

An overview of the protocols design is given in figure 
\ref{fig:bus:design:overview} \nameref{fig:bus:design:overview}. 
In the following sections parts of the protocol design are considered with more detail.
