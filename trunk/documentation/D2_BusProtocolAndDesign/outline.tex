The document provides the abstract bus protocol specifications 
in section \ref{sec:bus:specification}, the requirements claimed 
for the bus protocol are depicted in section \ref{sec:bus:requirements}, 
the design choosen for the implementation and the 
implementation details are outlined in section \ref{sec:bus:design} 
and the (currently defined) testcases needed to be validated by 
the implementation are shown in section \ref{sec:bus:testcases}.\\

The protocol details given in the following are 
designed generally independent from certain 
applications or projects, to be as reusable 
as possible for other aims. 
The first use of the protocol given below is in the application 
of our NES 2011/12 course project described in \cite[NESD1]{NESD1} and \cite[NESD3]{NESD3}.\\
