\section{Application specification}

\subsection{Bus load app}
Has the benefit of user adjustable provocation load rates for 
further testing

\subsection{Drift rates}
The main target of our application is to show drifts of the synchronous 
clocks in our network. 

That means that we are measuring:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The ability of the nodes to synchronate the clocks via the bus 
while it is under load due to the bus load app
 \item The drifts between the clocks before synchronising
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fault Injection via Buttons}

\subsection{Overload Simulation via Buttons}

\subsection{Debugging and Monitoring features via PC}
