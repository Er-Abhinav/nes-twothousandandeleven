This document specifies the application level of our project. Since the projects main aim is to design an ultra leightweight fault tolerant bus protocol (ULFTRTP) our
application level should provide guidance how to use the protocol for other developers and to test the protocol and the clock synchronization under certain load conditions of the bus.\\

The specification of the protocol and the clock synchronization is outlined in \cite[NESD2]{NESD2}.\\

This document gives an overview of our application in section \ref{sec:app:specification} \nameref{sec:app:specification} and defines how to use the bus and the clock synchronization via the app to cni interface in section \ref{sec:app:interfacing} \nameref{sec:app:interfacing}.
