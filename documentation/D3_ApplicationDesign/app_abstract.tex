This document specifies the application level of our project. Since the projects main aim is to design an ultra leightweight fault tolerant bus protocol (ULFTRTP) our
application level should provide guidance how to use the protocol for other developers and to test the protocol and the clock synchronization under certain load conditions of the bus.\\

The specification of the protocol and the clock synchronization is outlined in \cite[NESD2]{NESD2}. -------------In the following sections the tasks for the four nodes are given.
