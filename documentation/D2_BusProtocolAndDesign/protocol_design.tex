\section{Bus Protocol - Design}
\label{sec:bus:design}

According to Req \ref{req:ulftrtp:interfacing} we segmented the ULFTRTP in independent layers arbitrarily exchangable with respect to the below defined interfaces.\\

We will see in the subsequent sections the protocols CNI (Communication Network Interface) is considered as a stand alone component with push and pull interfaces.
As this is not always the case the overall control mechanisms of the protocol can slightly vary depending on the platform used.\\
