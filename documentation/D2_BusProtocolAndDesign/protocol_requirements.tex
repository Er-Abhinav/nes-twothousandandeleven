\section{Requirements}
\label{sec:bus:requirements}

\begin{req}
\label{req:ulftrtp:analyzeable}
\textbf{analyzeable: }the protocol has to be easy to analyze with respect to worst case timing.
\end{req}

\begin{req}
\label{req:ulftrtp:interfacing}
\textbf{interfacing: }the protocol design has to follow strictly interface guidelines. This means:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item lower levels of the protocol can only be accessed by higher levels through the defined layer interfaces.
 \item higher levels of the protocol cannot be accessed by lower levels. Data to higher layers can only be propagated 
using callback mechanisms. 
\end{enumerate}

\end{req}

\begin{req}
\label{req:ulftrtp:easy migration}
\textbf{migration: }the protocol has to be migratable in arbitrary applications with minimal effort.
\end{req}

\begin{req}
\label{req:ulftrtp:resource consumption}
\textbf{resource consumption: }the protocol has to be adaptable to minimal hardware constraints.
\end{req}
